A simple test tool package showing how Externalizer outputs the various methods of the Externalizer.   You can install and then run via [1].   There is a sample OSGi config sample at [2], which you can rename the node to [3] to get it to use it.

You can then use the "domains" field to enter "external,domain1,domain2" to see the output from these custom configurations.
